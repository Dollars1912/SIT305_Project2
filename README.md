Explanation Of Major Features:
Fungus: We used the Fungus plugin to do the dialogue between players and NPCS, and included all the scenarios. Players can explore the world of our game and the whole story from the conversation.

Level Designer: Level designer is a API in Unity, we used this to design all the levels which saves a lot of time and present a much better game experience and quality to the user.

Audio(background music): We used fungus to present BGmusic. BGmusic is necessary for a RPG game. Make the game more substitutive and give user a better game experience.

Animation: Our character and enemy has been fully animated(e.g. attack,walk,jump,die,landing etc). This is a smoother process to the game.

Particle System: Game effects will interact with the game process to make the game more realistic(e.g. CoinPickupSparkle, Explosion, PlayerLands, waterSplash etc).

Database: Database is very important for RPG games. Players can save the game and inherit the game. TODO HERE.

Depth of BG field and movable background: Depth of BG field can fit the Background image better in each level of the game. Movable background The movable background will make the game experience more improved.

Reward system/ Randomly drop equipment or props: We randomly set the drop system in the game, player can get reward when defeating an enemy or opening a treasure chest which increased playability of the game.

Different emenies: Added different tpyes of enemies into different levels. Different attack modes, HP values, movement mode.
